General Information - The Firm: Section 2. General Information - The Firm: Subsection 1. Provide a brief overview of the Firm including any business activities unrelated to the Fund's investment strategy.: \u00b7 Firm Overview: Headquartered in Toronto, Forum is a privately-owned alternative asset manager, investor and developer operating across Canada and the U.S. Forum was founded in 1996 as a real estate brokerage company, and after numerous successful real estate transactions, Forum launched its principal investment business in 2002. Since then, Forum's NAV has increased at a 30+% CAGR by acquiring and developing real estate, and by expanding into public private partnerships (PPPs), green energy, and urban infrastructure investments. Forum substantially exited its renewable energy and PPP businesses in 2018 and 2019, respectively. However, Forum continues to manage PPP assets, which it developed and sold (from 2016-2019) to Fiera Infrastructure. Today, Forum has a substantial balance sheet to invest alongside its unitholders to ensure strong alignment of interests. Forum has committed to maintaining a minimum $50 million investment in REIIF (i.e., the Sponsor Investment), with Forum currently the single largest investor in REIIF and anticipates continuing to be so for the foreseeable future.Over its 27-year history, Forum built extensive principal investment expertise in real estate and private equity. As of June 30, 2023, Forum had ~$1.7 billion in AUM as follows:Infrastructure Assets (~$865 million): Includes PPPs valued at ~$859 million, which Forum continues to manage, and renewable energy projects valued at ~$6 million, which Forum will exit over the next few years.\" Real Estate Assets (~$710 million): Includes commercial and residential stabilized real estate rental assets and development projects; and\" Private Equity Assets (~$76 million): Includes investments in the urban infrastructure sector.Figure 1 shows Forum's evolution from its inception in 1996 to date. Forum initially focused on real estate and then expanded its principal investing strategy into infrastructure. Forum's strategy has evolved from a principal investor to a multi-product asset manager, with a focus on impact-driven rental real estate and private equity investments. As part of its private equity strategy, Forum launched FUIOF I in December 2020 to invest in private companies providing impact- driven products and services in the built environment (i.e., urban infrastructure). Forum launched REIIF in Q4, 2021, which focuses on the Multi-Family, PBSA and Co-Living and Micro-unit residential real estate sectors.Figure 1: Timeline of Forum's Evolution (1996-2023)$30+% ANNUAL NAV GROWTH SINCE 20021996Forum 1.0Real Estate Leasing and Brokerage2001Forum 2.0Launch of Principal Investment Strategy (Real Estate Focus)20072015Forum 3.0 Built PPP and Renewable Energy BusinessFirm Size2020Forum 4.0Exit PPP and Renewable Energy BusinessLaunch Private Equity Platform2021+Forum 5.025-Year-Old Start UpAsset Manager, Investor and DeveloperLaunched FUIOF I ($75 M Closed) Launched REIIF (Initial Raise $125 M Open)2-15 Employees 3 Employees4-25 Employees10-14 Employees36 Employees\u00b7 Firm's Principal Investing Activities (2002-2023): Figure 2 below provides a snapshot of Forum's principal investing activities from 2002-2021, where it built real estate, renewable energy and PPP businesses.Figure 2: Overview of Forum's Principal Investing Activities (2002-2023)Investment FocusInfrastructurePrivate EquityReal EstateC$17 B enterprise value of assets under management30%+ Annual equity growth since 20021C$900M development pipelineDeveloped and sold 6 projects with total project costs of C$1B+Launched in 2018, targeting value-add infrastructure and essential servicesCurrently owns and manages a portfolio of 16 assets valued at C$600M-7x equity MOIC on developmentsSupported by expertise in real estate,Historical equity MOIC of >5.0xCurrently manage 8 operational public-privateprivate equity, and infrastructure.C$900M development pipelinepartnership assetsSeven investments to date in HVAC, out of home media, geothermal, telecom, home automation and retail energyA core-plus, open-ended private REIT launched in 2021 focused on stabilized Canadian residential rental real estate targeting an annual net IRR of 8-12%.

Firm's Current and Future Business Activities (2021-2023+): After the sale of its infrastructure assets, Forum's CEO, Richard Abboud, shifted Forum to being an asset manager of impact-driven private equity and real estate assets. Forum also hired 3 partners between 2018-2020 (see Question 2-2 below). In December 2020, Forum launched FUIOF I, which had a final closing of $75 million in September 2021. FUIOF I targets growing private companies that earn recurring revenues from products and services for the built environment. FUIOF I's investments are impact- driven urban infrastructure businesses, which should enhance Forum's ability to achieve a positive ESG impact for REIIF. Forum is launching REIIF as its flagship real estate offering, building on its principal investing strategy in residential real estate sectors. Forum's Real Estate platform focuses on 3 business activities: 1) development, 2) acquisitions, and 3) asset management. Forum's Real Estate Team seeks to deliver over $900 million of projects (see Question 4-6 for details on existing ROFO Pipeline Assets) over the next 5 years, and then expects to add ~$400 million of assets (completed value) p.a. as future ROFO Pipeline Assets..

Describe the Firm's competitive advantages.Forum's key competitive advantages are:1. Differentiated Strategy: Forum is one of a few large-scale developers of PBSA and is currently one of the largest developers of Co-Living and Micro-unit Communities in Canada. REIIF's strategy is clearly differentiated from both Canadian public REITs and private real estate funds, with a key focus on new, purpose-built residential rental housing in sub-sectors that have the opportunity to adjust rents to market more frequently than other real estate sectors.2. Business Platforms: Forum's cross-functional business platforms across real estate and private equity are unique to real estate investment and asset management firms in Canada. This cross-functionality provides REIIF with a unique ability to lever green technologies and service providers in its impact-driven real estate strategy.3. Development Expertise: Forum's investment professionals have decades of experience developing complex real estate projects working both independently and with partners, including various levels of government (e.g. Quad Phase I and II on campus at York University, CFB Borden federal government data centre). This expertise allows Forum to underwrite complex acquisitions and to build a proprietary pipeline of development projects that REIIF has exclusive access to on completion through the Fund's right of first offer (\"ROFO\").4. Agility: Forum's agile and entrepreneurial team has substantial experience efficiently underwriting and structuring complicated transactions across a variety of sectors, with the ability to make decisions quickly - a distinct advantage inForum's REIIF DDQ (Confidential)the hyper-competitive, multi-family sector, where REIIF can capitalize on off-market real estate equity and debt opportunities.5. Alignment: Forum's historical success as a balance sheet investor allows it to invest meaningfully alongside REIIF's investors. Forum has committed to maintaining a minimum $50 million investment in REIIF.6. Impact Focused: As an active, engaged and responsible developer and investor, Forum seeks attractive, risk-adjusted returns while positively impacting communities, the environment and other stakeholders (see Doc. 2.01 for Forum's ESG Policy in REIIF's data room). REIIF strives to deliver a sector leading impact and ESG driven portfolio that will enhance yields and total returns while future proofing the portfolio to ensure diversity and resiliency of income."}, {"id": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630_chunk_18", "filename": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630", "page_number": 21, "content": "Section 3.

REIIF's Investment Strategy: REIIF will invest in impact-driven, institutional-quality Canadian properties, which provide long-term, inflation-hedged and stable cash flows, with the opportunity for capital appreciation. In addition, REIIF may invest up to up to 5% of its NAV in private alternative assets and 10% of its NAV in publicly listed securities (e.g., Canadian REITs, REOCs and MICs), aligned with REIIF's investment objectives. The Manager targets residential rental real estate, focused on:\" Multi-Family: Assets located in supply-constrained markets underpinned by stable rent growth and strong demand;\u00b7 PBSA: Purpose-built student accommodation with strong growth tailwinds, supported by demographic and market fundamentals; and\" Co-Living and Micro-unit Communities: Properties located in urban markets that address the unmet needs of a significant demographic (including young professionals) by providing community, convenience and cost-effective housing.In some instances, REIIF may acquire assets that are not yet fully stabilized (e.g., due to leasing and minor CAPEX requirements), to capitalize on pricing dislocations due to impaired NOI. A key aspect of REIIF's strategy is creating impact-driven, long-term value by achieving ESG targets. Section 10 provides an overview of REIIF's ESG principles, factors and targets and its ESG integration strategy in the context of the Manager's investment process. The Manager seeks to add value at each step in the process by integrating and achieving its long-term ESG targets.\u00b7 REIIF's Key Investment Criteria: REIIF's key investment criteria include:\" Target Return: REIIF targets annual distributions to Unitholders of ~4-5% and total net returns of 8-12% for a minimum 5-year period, and assuming the Unitholder does not elect to participate in REIIF's DRIP and the Trust Units are not subject to a reduction on the Asset Management Fee (for Series F Units);\" Target Regions:O Multi-Family: Multi-Family apartments in greater Metropolitan Areas of Toronto (and the Greater Golden Horseshoe), Vancouver (and Vancouver Island), Montreal (including the North and South Shores), and the National Capital Region (Ottawa-Gatineau metropolitan area) and other supply constrained Canadian primary and secondary markets;:unselected: O PBSA: Purpose-built student accommodation in top university and college markets with a growing base of international and out-of-province students; andCo-Living and Micro-unit Communities: Properties in major economic centres, such as Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and Ottawa.\u00b7 Ownership Stakes: The Manager will target full ownership of each property but may consider interests below 100% if the investment is sufficiently attractive, and the Manager is involved in the strategic financing and operating decisions.\" Investment Pacing: Current portfolio assets have an estimated FMV of ~$406 million (at June 30, 2023) and ~$433 million following the acquisition of ALMA Guelph on July 12, 2023 from the ROFO Pipeline. The Manager has access to existing ROFO Pipeline Assets valued at ~$900 million over the next 5 years (2023-2027).

What are the expected trends in the selected sectors over the next 5+ years?: . REIIF's Target Sectors to Grow Over Next Decade:REIIF's Target Sectors are poised for solid growth over the nextdecade as:O Canada's Population Growth Continues to Outpace Housing Supply and Should Accelerate2: The backdrop of the growth in the share of the renting population is one of imbalance between housing supply and demand, with population growth forecasted to accelerate through increased immigration.3 Immigration Canada reported that 405,000 new immigrants were welcomed in 2021 despite the impact of the global pandemic, with Canada further aiming to welcome 465,000 new permanent residents in 2023, 485,000 in 2024, and 500,000 in 2025. In contrast, housing completions across Canada were just under 140,000 in 2021.4 Further, major cities are expected to continue experiencing the highest rates of population growth. By 2030, Toronto's population is expected to grow by 460,000, Montreal by 350,000 and Ottawa by 140,000 from 2020 levels. Finally, as reported by Scotiabank, Canada has the lowest housing per 1,000 people in the G7 and to meet the average of G7 countries, Canada needs to add 1.9 million homes.5o Affordability Gap Continues to Widen Between Renting and Owning: While Canadian home prices largely declined from their COVID-19 peaks, high inflation and rising interest rates due to tightening monetary policy caused a further deterioration in housing affordability. As reported by National Bank, mortgage payments as a percentage of homeowners' income are now at 67.3% throughout Canada (with markets such as Toronto representing a staggering 93% of median income).6:unselected: o Rental Housing as a Percentage of Total Housing Stock Will Increase: In mature markets such as Germany and Switzerland, renters represent 55% and 58% of the total population, respectively. Renting a home is commonplace in many countries, and will likely become more commonplace across Canada, especially in major cities. In recent years, our census showed that the increase in renters outpaced that of homeowners over the past decade in each of the country's largest urban centers.7 (Note: Rental rate growth and rent collection in REIIF's Target Sectors were resilient during COVID-19's darkest days).8\u00b7 Expected Trends in REIIF's Target Sectors Over 5+ Years: Table 5 summarizes REIIF's key investment themes and drivers of current and future opportunities for the next 5+ years (Note: Reference number details are on the next page).For \"Table 5: REIIF's Key Investment Themes and Drivers of Current and Future Opportunities\": For row 2, Details is Key Drivers of Target Assets,Multi-Family is \u00b7 Underpinned by stable rent growth and strong demand including, without limitation, assets serving specific communities such as seniors, workforce, indigenous and other communities:,PBSA is \u00b7 Strong growth tailwinds are supported by market and demographic fundamentals,Co-Living and Micro-unit Communities is \u00b7 Addresses unmet needs of a significant demographic by providing community, convenience, and cost-effective housing,.For row 3, Details is o Average rents in major Canadian :unselected: markets grew by 3.22% (10-year CAGR from 2011-2021)1,.For row 4, Details is o Average occupancy rates were :unselected: 97.1% (2011-2021)1,2 Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, 2020 Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration. 3 Statistics Canada, Population Projections for Canada (2021 to 2068), August 2022, National Bank. 4 CMHC, Housing Starts, Completions and Units Under Construction, November 2022. 5 Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, 2022 Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration. 6 National Bank, Housing Affordability Monitor, November 2022. 7 The Globe and Mail, Canada's homeownership rate falls to 20-year low, census shows, September 2022 8 CBRE Canadian Multi-Family in the Post-Pandemic, 2021.

The Partnership also arranged a secured RCF of up to $55 million (comprised of an initial $25 million limit and an accordion facility allowing the facility to be increased up to three times in an amount of $10 million each time) from a Canadian financial institution.

As noted, Forum has provided an unsecured loan (i.e., a backstop) of $10 million for liquidity purposes to the Partnership. The terms of the loan extended by Forum to the Partnership were approved by REIIF's Board. In summary, REIIF's portfolio- level leverage strategy will:\" Target an LTV of 55% for REIIF's portfolio;\" Include a secured RCF of up to $55 million to manage short-term capital needs, including redemptions and bridge financing for acquisitions, until long-term debt can be placed;\" Optimize debt using CMHC-insured fixed-rate debt to minimize interest-rate volatility and reduce interest costs;\" Use a diversified base of Canadian mortgage providers; and\" Bundle assets when appropriate to generate better lending terms for the Partnership.\u00b7 REIIF's Property-Level Debt Strategy: The Partnership primarily secures asset-level debt, which in aggregate across the portfolio is targeted not to exceed 55% of the Partnership's gross book value, inclusive of Partnership-level indebtedness. In certain instances, where beneficial due to pricing and strong debt-service coverage, the Partnership may target specific property leverage above this 55% threshold. In other situations, the Partnership may employ an unlevered / unencumbered debt strategy. The Manager will employ an active and institutionalized approach to debt management and will vary debt terms, depending on REIIF's weighted-average interest rate and debt maturity. However, where assets being acquired do not currently have CMHC-insured debt in place and/or if assets being acquired have short-term leasing risk, REIIF may place short-term bridge facilities on acquisitions until CMHC-insured debt can be secured and the Fund may consider forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for the permanent, term financing that would repay the bridge."}, {"id": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630_chunk_28", "filename": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630", "page_number": 26, "content": "Section 4.

Value Growth: Based on NOI growth divided by the cap rate and assumes no cap-rate compression .. Unlevered Return: Excludes all financing costs and fees, such as the RCF and CMHC fees. Leverage: Includes property-level debt and the RCF. Asset Management Fee: Based on a fee of 1.25% plus HST.

No Guarantees: The target annual distributions and the target total net return are not guaranteed. The expectation, timing and payment of annual distributions and the total net return targets are based on the noted assumptions and subject to certain risks.\u00b7 Value Creation for REIIF's Investments: Given its expertise in real estate transactions and real estate asset management, the Manager expects to create significant opportunities to add value including:\" Conversion and/or intensification of under-used space to additional leasable area, or amenity areas, both of which ultimately drive higher rents;\" Energy-reduction strategies (see Section 10 on ESG), which will ultimately drive lower consumption and/or rates, thereby increase operating margins;Forum's REIIF DDQ (Confidential)\" Social-engagement strategies (see Question 10-3), that improve affordability, diversity and inclusion leading to higher tenant demand; and\" Renovation / updating of suites and common areas that will allow REIIF to maximize rents and reduce operating costs.Refer to Doc. 4.04 for the Case Study: The Quad (Phase 1) in the REIIF data room, which illustrates how Forum can help to create value for REIIF.ESG Impact to Help Enhance REIIF's Long-Term Returns: REIIF's focus on ESG impact will bolster returns and enhance long-term asset values. For example, in 2020, First Insights' U.S. study showed that consumers across broad age groups \"were willing to pay more for impact-driven products\". While only 50% of respondents in the Silent Generation and 58% of Baby Boomers said they would pay more for impact-driven products, Millennials and Generation Z responded with 68% and 73%, respectively. Given REIIF's focus on PBSA and Co-Living and Micro-unit communities, which appeal to Millennials and Generation Z, REIIF should generate solid returns over the long term. Additional ESG considerations:\" Enhance REIIF's Assets Energy Efficiency: REIIF will invest in energy upgrades, such as LED lighting fixtures, sensors, occupancy controls, high-efficiency HVAC equipment, including building-automation systems, triple- glazed windows, etc. These upgrades can generate 20-30% energy savings9. Since most Multi-Family apartment buildings built in Canada post the 1980s are separately metered for electricity10, energy reductions translate to lower tenant utility costs, thereby increasing their ability to pay rent.\" Proactively Lower REIIF's Carbon Footprint: As most major Canadian jurisdictions move toward net-zero carbon targets11, many real estate investors view environmental sustainability upgrades as a necessity to preserve asset values. Since REIIF's mandate includes a pro-active ESG impact strategy, the growth in value of REIIF's assets should outpace general market values over time."}, {"id": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630_chunk_30", "filename": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630", "page_number": 29, "content": "Section 4.

Investment Process: Section 5. Investment Process: Subsection 1. Describe the Firm's investment process for the Fund.: Forum's investment process for REIIF covers the following 5 key steps, which is described in detail below:\" Step 1 - Source Property Investments and Conduct Initial Assessment;\" Step 2 - Conduct Due Diligence on Property and Develop Property's Business Plan;\" Step 3 - Present Property to Forum's IC, REIIF's Board and Close Transaction;\" Step 4 - Onboard the Approved Investment, Manage the Property and REIIF's Total Portfolio; and\" Step 5 - Sell the Property if Appropriate and Redeploy Capital.. Step 1 - Source Property Investments and Conduct Initial Assessment: The Manager employs a well-defined and robust investment process for all real estate transactions. All potential property transactions are vetted by Aly Damji during weekly Real Estate Team \"pipeline review\" meetings. These meetings address new business and cover updates on investment opportunities, including pricing expectations, potential transaction terms and timelines. Prior to submitting a non-binding letter of intent, all potential transactions must be approved by Forum's Investment Committee (IC), through an initial screening memo. Before a transaction progresses beyond the non- binding letter of intent stage (i.e., once high-level transaction terms have been negotiated, but before a purchase- and-sale agreement is executed or significant resources are committed to the transaction), the opportunity is formally presented to Forum's IC for approval.Once opportunities are approved for due diligence by Forum's IC, a \"Deal Team\" is formed comprising various Real Estate Team members, where the Team seeks to achieve the optimal outcome for each transaction based on REIIF's investment thesis, its ESG targets and its risk management policies. The Manager takes a multi-faceted approach to due diligence by levering the Team's diverse skillsets, including expertise across investments, asset management, planning and development, project management, finance, and tax.. Step 2 - Conduct Due Diligence on Property and Develop Property Business Plan: In evaluating a potential transaction for its adherence to REIIF's investment thesis, its ESG targets and risk management policies, the Manager conducts thorough due diligence to analyze and evaluate each investment opportunity. Table 11 summarizes the due diligence items assessed to confirm the investment thesis, and these items also inform each property business plan.For \"Table 22\": For row 0, column1 is Table 11: Overview of REIIF's Due Diligence Items for Each Property,.For row 1, column1 is \" Physical asset quality \" Capital investment required to enhance asset useful life and,column2 is \" Key risks and opportunities related to REIIF's ESG targets,.For row 2, column1 is (see Section 10),.For row 3, column1 is to drive ESG opportunities,column2 is \" Market supply and demand analysis for both the short and,.For row 4, column1 is \u00b7 Revenue-enhancement opportunities including,column2 is long term,.For row 5, column1 is intensification and greater tenant / community engagement,column2 is \" In-place financing and/or financing options,.For row 6, column1 is \u00b7 Cost-reduction opportunities include greater:,column2 is \" Suitable third-party property managers that can execute on,.For row 7, column1 is a.

Step 3 - Present Property to Forum's IC, REIIF's Board and Close Transaction: As transactions progress through the due diligence process, the Manager prepares a preliminary IC Memo to summarize its work, and to facilitate vetting of the opportunity internally. The IC Memo is reviewed with Aly Damji and distributed to the Manager's finance team for input. Once due diligence is completed, and the results are integrated into the property's final IC Memo, the Deal Team formally presents the opportunity to Forum's IC for recommendation to be approved by REIIF's Board.Once a transaction is approved by REIIF's Board, the property is prepared for onboarding. The onboarding process includes securing financing and preparing to implement the property's business plan (e.g., obtaining quotes or permits for CAPEX, engaging a third-party property manager and associated service contracts, engaging leasing agents, setting up bank accounts, etc.).\u00b7 Step 4 - Onboard the Approved Investment, Manage the Property and REIIF's Total Portfolio: Post the property's closing, the Manager's Real Estate Asset Management Team is responsible for:\" Proactively managing the property and creating value through various initiatives identified during the due diligence process (and typically detailed in the property's business plan);\" Executing REIIF's asset management strategy, including oversight of third-party property managers that conduct the day-to-day execution of each property's business plan;\u00b7 Closely monitoring each property and total portfolio quarterly performance through a rigorous asset management review and reporting process. See Section 6 in REIIF's data room for examples of the quarterlyInvestor Report including financial results and operational results (e.g., occupancy, leasing updates, development initiatives), and risk management;\" Updating each property business plan annually (or more frequently if necessary), by collaborating with third- party property managers; and\" Proactively assessing all potential risks in REIIF's portfolio and ensuring that REIIF remains well diversified across its Target Sectors and its Target Regions.. Step 5 - Sell the Property if Appropriate and Redeploy Capital: As part of REIIF's annual strategic business plan, the Manager reviews opportunities and threats on a portfolio basis, evaluating Target Sector and Target Region allocations and related market factors. As noted, each property's business plan is developed and reassessed annually to ensure alignment with REIIF's overall investment strategy, including meeting future return expectations. Also, a multi-year capital allocation plan in the context of REIIF's overall strategy is created, and assets may be divested if they do not fit with REIIF's long-term strategy and/or if capital cannot be recycled effectively to meet REIIF's return expectations. If the Manager recommends an asset for disposition, it is brought forward to REIIF's Board for approval, subject to Approval Limits."}, {"id": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630_chunk_41", "filename": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630", "page_number": 35, "content": "Section 5.

Investment Process: Subsection 3. What models, metrics and guidelines does the Firm use during underwriting to analyze potential investments?: The Manager's ranking analysis of potential REIIF acquisitions includes evaluating the following:\" Geographic Location: The Manager assesses whether the target asset fits the geographic parameters defined foreach Target Sector (i.e., Multi-Family, PBSA, and Co-Living and Micro-unit) and whether there is ongoing and expected long-term rental growth;\" Cap Rate, AFFO Yield, and Levered IRR: The Manager assesses if the target asset will meet REIIF's objective of delivering ~4-5% stabilized annual distributions, the AFFO yield and if the target asset will meet a total net return of 8-12% over a minimum 5-year period (for Series F Units and assuming the Unitholder does not elect to participate in the Fund's DRIP);\" Opportunity for Impact Based on ESG Targets: Finally, the Manager assesses if the target asset currently (or in future) provides opportunities for significant ESG impact (based on REIIF's ESG targets). The Manager also assesses if one or more of the asset's characteristics may detract from REIIF's impact-driven strategy (e.g., does the asset require significant tenant displacement to generate its target returns?) (see Question 10-4 for a detailed review of ESG integration into REIIF's investment process.)All underwriting metrics are tied to REIIF's target returns, both at the asset level and at the portfolio level. All underwriting assumptions are validated by market comparables (e.g., based on rents, cap rates, occupancy levels) and/or through a ground-up / zero-based budget process (e.g., based on operating expenses, renovation costs, etc.), with assistance from third-party specialists (e.g., property managers, property tax consultants, etc.).The Forum Team's significant experience and expertise as a real estate owner and operator, enables it as the Manager to perform a comprehensive assessment of physical asset quality, capital-investment requirements and opportunities, revenue-enhancement and cost-reduction opportunities. Also, the Manager assesses the property's business, market, operating and contingent risks and opportunities, to develop an investment thesis that will serve as the basis for the property's business and financing plan. In its underwriting, the Manager determines the property's exit cap rates by assessing interest-rate projections, projected capital flows in the relevant markets and sectors, and the property's projected quality and fundamentals. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the property to test the potential cash flow and return impacts based on specific scenarios. The factors considered when preparing best-case and worst- case scenarios vary on a deal-by-deal basis, but generally include market-leasing assumptions, property occupancy, rental rates, leasing incentives, financing, leverage assumptions, exit timing, exit valuations and tax structuring. As noted, the Manager also assesses REIIF ESG targets throughout its underwriting process (see Question 10-4)."}, {"id": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630_chunk_43", "filename": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630", "page_number": 36, "content": "Section 5.

As noted, a bottom-up individual property business plan is developed initially and reassessed annually to ensure alignment with REIIF's overall investment strategy, including meeting future return expectations. A multi-year capital allocation plan in the context of REIIF's overall strategy is created, and assets may be divested if they do not fit with REIIF's long-term strategy and/or to recycle capital effectively to meet return expectations. As noted, if the Manager recommends an asset for disposition, it is brought forward to REIIF's Board for approval, subject to Approval Limits.\u00b7 Forecasts for Asset-Level Returns and Portfolio-Level Return: Property-level rolling 10-year models are updated by the Real Estate Team at least quarterly, with specific assumptions for the first 2 years, and market assumptions for the remaining periods. Ad-hoc updates are completed as appraisals are received, and updated operating budgets are finalized. REIIF's portfolio-level returns for a given period are calculated by SGGG and audited annually by Grant Thornton."}, {"id": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630_chunk_45", "filename": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630", "page_number": 37, "content": "Section 5.

As a hands-on asset manager, the Manager addresses any variance against the established annual budget as quickly as possible. If a property is performing below pro-forma / budget in the property's business plan, the Asset Management Team takes a proactive, hands-on approach to mitigate risks and increase performance. For example, Forum completed construction on a large PBSA residence in Winnipeg, during COVID-19. While the property is trending slightly below its pro-forma leasing projections, Forum provided an \"out-of-the-box\" solution to increase leasing velocity by:\" Introducing its third-party property manager to a new digital roommate matching service, that opens the property to Co-Living and Micro-units in addition to student housing; and\" Creating a partnership with the University of Manitoba to have their shuttle service available at the property. While the property is on the edge of campus, it is a 20-minute walk to the campus centre.

Forum seeks to ensure that risk is managed as close to its source as possible, and by the teams with the most knowledge and expertise in a particular business or risk area. Forum uses a thorough and integrated risk-assessment process to identify and evaluate risk areas across the Firm, such as human capital and other strategic, financial, regulatory, and operational risks. Risk management and mitigation approaches and practices are tailored to the particular risk areas and executed by the business and functional groups, with appropriate coordination and oversight through risk monitoring and reporting processes.Investment risks are managed and monitored by Forum's CFO with the respective investment teams. Forum's IC, chaired by Richard Abboud, also provides oversight and guidance to Forum's investment teams when evaluating opportunities, including assessing projected returns, the investment thesis and the viability of the investment case, the market environment, and alignment with a fund's objectives, as well as providing final approval for all transactions. Business-specific risks (such as operations, health and safety) are generally managed at the portfolio company level (for private equity), as risks differ in each asset class. Forum provides strategic direction and monitors many of these risks on a firm-wide basis to ensure effective risk management and best practices.For risks that are more pervasive and correlated in their impact across Forum, such as those relating to liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rates, or where Forum brings specialized knowledge, Forum uses a centralized approach to risk management at the corporate level. Managing strategic, reputational and regulatory risks is coordinated by Forum's CFO to ensure a consistent focus and implementation across the Firm.Monitoring Investment Risks Across Forum's Platforms: As stated, Forum's IC oversees the investment risk- management process, which Forum believes is vital to the successful execution of a given investment strategy. In providing Forum's investment teams with oversight and guidance, the IC is responsible for:\" Working with the respective investment teams informally as they assess opportunities;\" Evaluating opportunities and reviewing the associated risks and mitigation strategies;\" Identifying and resolving conflicts early in the investment process;\" Providing the ultimate approval to pursue a transaction; and\" Monitoring the ongoing performance of all investments."}, {"id": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630_chunk_77", "filename": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630", "page_number": 49, "content": "Section 9.

Additionally, Forum aligned its three impact verticals with United Nations Sustainability Development Goals, which as a collective are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and to ensure that by 2030 all people will enjoy peace and prosperity.REIIF's investments will address one or more of our three sustainability development goals aligned impact pillars, which are focused on improving existing buildings to reduce environmental footprint while creating long term value for the local community.1. Efficient & Climate Resilient Buildings: Own and operate sustainable real estate that considers energyconsumption, limits carbon emissions, reduces waste and water and sources materials responsibly.2. Community Empowerment & Prosperity: Develop and implement solutions that address housing attainability issues, improve community safety, positively impact resident's health and wellness, and build social equity within the neighbourhoods we invest.3.

Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\"): Subsection 4. Describe how the Firm integrates ESG factors into the Fund's investment process?: The Manager has a robust due diligence process to assess new investment opportunities and to develop annual business plans by property to address ESG factors and progress toward achieving ESG targets. As noted in Question 5-1, REIIF's investment process covers 5 steps, and the Manager addresses ESG factors in each step:o Step 1 - Source Property Investments and Conduct Initial Assessment: During the initial screening of a property, the Manager identifies material ESG factors (risks and opportunities) relevant to the potential investment, by reviewing publicly available data. Table 18 is completed for every prospective investment:For \"Table 18: Example of ESG Factors Assessed When Screening a Property\": For row 2, Ref. is 1,Example of ESG Factors Assessed is Subject to fines or unpaid taxes,Diligence Completed is ,Pass / Fail is ,Comments is ,.For row 3, Ref. is 2,Example of ESG Factors Assessed is Contaminated or at risk of contamination issues, relating to soil or groundwater,Diligence Completed is ,Pass / Fail is ,Comments is ,.For row 4, Ref. is 3,Example of ESG Factors Assessed is Vulnerable to potential expropriation due to government infrastructure plans,Diligence Completed is ,Pass / Fail is ,Comments is ,.For row 5, Ref. is 4,Example of ESG Factors Assessed is Research vendor for any publicly available information regarding ESG track record (including breaches) and possible motivations for sale,Diligence Completed is ,Pass / Fail is ,Comments is ,Any material ESG breaches will result in a \"Fail.\" The Manager assesses the risks and may elect not to proceed with the investment if there is a significant ESG breach, including but not limited to:\" Human rights' violations;\" Corruption / bribery related to the seller; and/or\" Significant environmental impact.The results of the initial ESG screening in Step 1 are reported to Forum's IC. If the prospective investment receives \"Pass\" ratings, or an adequate mitigation strategy is developed to address \"Fail\" ratings, the investment will proceed to due diligence.o Step 2 - Conduct Due Diligence on Property and Develop Property's Business Plan: Once a transaction progresses to due diligence, the Manager analyzes ESG factors more thoroughly to assess ESG risks and opportunities, and to develop an action plan to address ESG deficiencies and risks. Areas of due diligence focus on REIIF's ESG factors and targets. Refer to Doc. 2.03 for REIIF's ESG Due Diligence Checklist in REIIF's data room.ESG Factor Risk Rating: As Table 19-A shows, the Manager assigns each ESG factor a risk rating. While the total aggregated risk rating provides an investment's overall ESG risk, it is essential to assess the details to determine where the high and severe risks might make the property ill-suited for acquisition.For \"Table 19-A: Risk Rating Relating to ESG Factors\": For row 3, -1 is \u00b7 Potential for significant cost or delay in achieving asset repositioning plans . Cost to address the issue may be difficult to determine, but is likely to be high or prohibitive,0 is \u00b7 ESG risk factor is of high materiality, must be addressed and is a significant expense in terms of time and/or cost \u00b7 Mitigating or eliminating the risk is possible if remaining terms of the deal are favorable,1 is . ESG risk factor is of lower materiality and may or may not make financial sense to address during repositioning,2 is \u00b7 Material ESG risk factor (whether of lower or high materiality), can be addressed with a viable investment and time horizon \u00b7 ESG risk factor has been addressed by the previous owner,\" ESG Target Score: Potential acquisitions are also evaluated for their impact on REIIF's ESG targets. Any potential acquisition that receives a score of -1 is considered a red flag against proceeding with the acquisition. Table 19-B shows the ESG targets' scoring criteria:For \"Table 19-B: Risk Rating Relating to ESG Targets\": For row 2, Negative Potential is -1,Low Potential is 0,Medium Potential is 1,High Potential is 2,.For row 3, Negative Potential is . The site is expected to detract / diverge from the ESG target, it is not feasible to rectify the issue,Low Potential is \u00b7 The site will not adequately contribute to achieving the ESG target,Medium Potential is . The site will meet or sufficiently contribute to achieving the ESG target,High Potential is \u00b7 The site is expected to exceed the ESG target,\" ESG Action Plan: The Manager completes an ESG Action Plan to address any low scores and to identify impact opportunities. Plans to meet REIIF's ESG targets (both near- and long-term) are developed for each property, together with the related performance measures to assess progress toward the ESG target. The ESG Action Plan contains a specific work scope together with the timeline to start and complete the work.The Real Estate Team reviews the ESG Action Plan to determine the pricing and scheduling required to rectify any low scores and/or to implement opportunities through:\" Contacting vendors / service contractors directly to obtain quotes and determine timing;\" Working with the property's third-party property manager to confirm pricing and scheduling; and\" Benchmarking costs against other fund or Firm real estate assets.Once the costs and schedule are determined and validated, they are included in the property's IC Memo, which is reviewed by Forum's IC and subject to approval by REIIF's Board.o Step 3 - Present Property to Forum's IC, REIIF's Board, and Close Transaction: As transactions progress through REIIF's due diligence process, the Real Estate Team prepares an IC Memo to summarize its work and to facilitate vetting of the opportunity by Forum's IC. The IC Memo is circulated to Forum's IC and outlines the following:\" A summary of each Risk Rating and Target Score for each ESG due diligence category;\" Disclosure of material ESG issues identified during diligence and an assessment of their potential impact on valuation;\" A summary of the post-acquisition ESG Action Plan including scope, cost and timing; and\" The completed REIIF ESG Due Diligence Checklist (see Doc. 2.03 in REIIF's data room) is included as an appendix to the IC Memo.Thereafter, the Manager formally presents the opportunity to Forum's IC and REIIF's Board.o Step 4 - Onboard the Approved Investment, Manage the Property and REIIF's Total Portfolio: The Manager follows its Impact Management Framework to ensure that ESG factors and targets (risks and opportunities) are actively managed, monitored and reported at the asset level through:\" Annual Business Planning: Annual business plans are developed for all REIIF's properties and aligned with the IC Memo approved by REIIF's Board. Each property's annual business plan includes capital allocations and schedules for impact-driven initiatives, describing emerging ESG risks and opportunities, and annual reporting on ESG targets.\" Third-Party Property Manager Sourcing: Property managers are selected based on their ESG track record (including no significant ESG breaches and policies related to sustainability, inclusion, human rights, etc.).\" Third-Party Management Contracts: Contracts include a requirement to adhere to Forum's ESG Policy.\" Monthly Reporting: Reports prepared by third-party property managers must update ESG initiatives planned or completed at the site level and relating to ESG capital projects.The Manager ensures that REIIF's overall ESG targets and ESG factors (risks and opportunities) are actively managed, monitored and reported at the portfolio level through:\" REIIF's Quarterly Reports: Quarterly REIIF reports will include an update on impact initiatives, risks, and progress toward meeting the said ESG targets, and updates on any certifications achieved (such as LEED or BOMA), and asset-level reports provided by third-party property managers.REIIF's Annual ESG Impact Report: The annual REIIF ESG Impact Report will be provided to Unitholders by May 31st each year and will include a::unselected: o Summary of REIIF's ESG strategy;o Summary of ESG capital projects;o Operating-cost reductions due to ESG initiatives;o Annual scorecard based on REIIF's ESG targets;o Summary of progress toward meeting REIIF's ESG targets; and o Future ESG actions.\" PRI / GRESB Reports: The Manager submitted REIIF's first GRESB report in 2022 for FY 2021, and the results of the GRESB assessment will be shared with REIIF's Unitholders and included in REIIF's Annual ESG Impact Report. Similarly, the Manager will complete the annual PRI Report for FY 2022.\" Certifications: The Manager will consider building certification like LEED and BOMA for REIIF's assets, where possible.o Step 5 - Sell the Property if Appropriate and Redeploy Capital: By implementing REIIF's ESG process, the Manager will have the required ESG information available to facilitate a property's sale from an ESG perspective. Potential buyers can access all the key ESG initiatives and ESG targets achieved by the Manager relating to the said property. Also, REIIF can transfer key contracts, relationships, and processes to the new property buyer, so that ESG efforts can be continued and enhanced in the future. If similar competing offers are received, the Manager will consider the buyer's ESG credentials when selecting which offer to accept."}, {"id": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630_chunk_82", "filename": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630", "page_number": 54, "content": "Section 10.

Provide a table detailing the Firm's real estate track record by current and historical funds, separate account mandates, etc.: While Forum's extensive track record, reputation and experience across numerous alternative asset classes was built over 25 years, other than the 2 vehicles noted in Question 2-5, Forum has not managed any funds or separate accounts for third-party capital (Note: Forum has an asset management agreement with Fiera Infrastructure, where Forum asset manages the infrastructure investments on Fiera's behalf, where Fiera owns 100% of the assets). Rather, Forum invested as a principal investor, and since 2002, Forum's real estate investments, executed primarily as a principal investor using its own capital, spanned residential to commercial properties. Forum's real estate acumen has generated a 100+% IRR and more than a 6x MOIC on its real estate investments from 2002-June 30, 2022 (\"Real Estate Performance\"). REIIF is Forum's first open-ended real estate fund offering, where investors can invest alongside one of Canada's top-tier real estate investors.Since the strategies that generated Forum's Real Estate Performance are not directly comparable to REIIF's investment strategy, the Manager has provided illustrative returns for REIIF's largest and most significant property, The Quad (Phase 1). Since the completion and opening of The Quad (Phase 1) for the 2017 school year to the end of the 2021 school year (i.e., Sep 2017-Aug 2022), The Quad (Phase 1) generated an NOI CAGR of ~5%. Furthermore, with an LTV of 55% (being REIIF's target leverage) and assuming a 0.68% spread to the 10-year Canada Mortgage Bond, The Quad (Phase 1) would have earned an annualized cash yield of 5.3-7.8%, and gross total annual returns after the first year of ownership ranging from 8.7-15.2%.Forum engaged Grant Thornton in 2021 to assess Forum's overall investment track record, from Forum's inception as a principal investor in 2002 to June 30, 2022, to assist prospective Subscribers with due diligence on Forum's track record. Refer to Grant Thornton's review in Doc. 4.01 for Forum's Real Estate Track Record, and Docs. 4.02 and 4.03 for Forum's Overall Track Record in REIIF's data room. In summary, given Richard Abboud, Aly Damji and Rajeev Viswanathan's deep expertise across the real estate sector in Canada, coupled with Forum's track record over the last 2 decades, the Manager is confident that REIIF will deliver strong total returns to Unitholders.

Accounting, Valuation and Reporting: Section 12. Accounting, Valuation and Reporting: Subsection 1. Describe the Fund's internal accounting systems and key controls. What accounting principles does the Fund operate under?: \u00b7 REIIF's Internal Accounting Systems and Key Controls: Property management and the related-property accounting for REIIF's properties will be outsourced to reputable third-party service providers with expertise in REIIF's relevant assets and geographic regions (the \"Property Manager(s)\"). Accordingly, REIIF's internal accounting systems, processes and related controls are focused on:a. Consolidating Accounts: Given the limited number of properties at REIIF's inception, the Manager will use Forum's general ledger system and MS Excel-based tools to consolidate all property investments to determine REIIF's monthly NAV per unit for each series (in conjunction with SGGG). The Manager has also implemented specialized real estate software (e.g., Yardi), for general ledger accounting and to automate the monthly consolidation process.b. Monitoring and Managing Cash: Every property has a multi-year business plan with a monthly budget developed by the Manager and the Property Manager for the next calendar year. Actual monthly results are compared to budget and prior year results, to understand variances and expected property cash flows. Budgeted expenditures of $5,000+ require at least 2 quotes. Expenditures outside the annual budget of $2,000+ require the Manager's approval. Whenever possible, expenditures must conform to Forum's ESG Policy and promote progress toward meeting ESG targets.Since rents are recurring, a monthly rent-roll-to-revenue reconciliation and outstanding accounts receivable review is performed to ensure completeness and accuracy of rental revenues. For operating costs (and since expenses are generally also recurring), a dedicated 'zero-balance' disbursements account (\"AP Account\") is set up for each property. Invoices are received directly by the Property Manager, who will periodically request payments on a property-level account, which the Manager transfers to the AP Account to satisfy payments.c. Valuations: Each property's FMV is determined by an annual appraisal, prepared by an independent firm, with quarterly reviews of FMV performed by the Manager for intervening periods. All changes are documented, with audit procedures performed on valuations as part of REIIF's annual audit.d. Investor Record-Keeping: REIIF will use SGGG for fund administration, including maintaining the Unitholder register, and reconciling Unitholder subscription and redemption amounts monthly with the Manager. Also, SGGG will administer the monthly distributions.\u00b7 REIIF's Accounting Principles: The Manager will perform the accounting for REIIF, according to IFRS and will apply the guidance under IAS 40 Investment Property. Under this standard, an Investment Property is initially measured at cost upon acquisition, with FMV changes being recognized in profit or loss.REIIF can also invest up to 5% of its NAV in private alternative assets and up to 10% of its NAV in listed public securities (mainly Canadian REITs, REOCs, MICs and/or money market securities).\" Listed Securities: These securities will generally have prices determined in an active public market and will be valued monthly at the security's closing bid price on the last trading date of the month."}, {"id": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630_chunk_96", "filename": "forum-duediligencequestionnaire20230630", "page_number": 61, "content": "Section 12.
