The Fund acquired Forum's 70% ownership interest in Quad I on November 26, 2021.Quad I, located on-campus at York University (Canada's third largest), benefits from an irreplaceable location in a newly- transit connected hub.

Does it mean that because it is CMHC insured, the loan is provided by the banks at a cheaper rate OR the loans is provided by CMHC.

CMHC insured mortgages lowers the effective cost of borrowing, with the CMHC attempting to stimulate an increase in the supply of rental housing to improve affordability and promote housing development.The CMHC product REIIF will use, involves loans from traditional lenders and banks that are insured by CMHC - resulting in a lower interest rate than conventional, uninsured mortgages. In this instance, CMHC charges the borrower fees, insurance premiums and surcharges which are deducted from the loan amount; however, results in the lowest cost of debt capital (and lower debt service) relative to other forms of real estate financing, especially since REIIF will be limiting LTV exposure to below 65%.Information on CMHC fees, insurance premiums and surcharges can be found here:https://assets.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/sf/project/cmhc/pdfs/content/en/fees-and-premiums.pdf"}, {"id": "Capstone_Responses_24-02-2022_chunk_11", "client_name": "Capstone", "document_name": "Responses", "date": "2022-02-24 00:00:00", "page_number": 4, "content": "7.

Why not an emphasis on multi-family for the 4 years growth since this is a more resilient sector?REIIF's portfolio has been designed to focus on traditional multi-family, purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) and Co- living housing (Co-Living).We believe the focus on the latter two multi-family sectors provides REIIF unitholders the ability to achieve superior risk- adjusted returns, particularly given the higher tenant turnover relative to traditional multi-family apartments - as rents tend to more frequently get 'marked-to-market' given the transitional nature of PBSA and Co-Living.The opportunity to move rents to market more frequently, particularly in an increasing inflation and interest rate environment, should result in higher cash flows and more resilient valuations given the higher expected growth in income over time relative to all other types of real estate.Further, with a shortfall of 600,000 student housing beds in Canada and lack of institutional quality operators / investors, we believe PBSA focused in supply constrained markets should result in superior long-term growth prospects - with Quad I and subsequent Quad phases (i.e. that REIIF has a ROFO to acquire) representing the most attractive student housing project in all of Canada.Similarly, with Co-living also being transitional in nature - typically occupied by young professionals in urban environments, not only are there greater opportunity for rents to be 'marked-to-market', but Co-living solves some of the challenges of housing affordability.

How would REIIF fit within a portfolio?The typical portfolio mix, with a 60% allocation to equities and 40% to fixed income, in an environment where bonds are yielding negative 'real' returns dictates a review of the role fixed income has traditionally played.Real assets, which includes assets such as timberlands, infrastructure, and real estate (\"Real Assets\"), offers an alternative to fixed income - given the ability for Real Assets to generate positive 'real' returns in a low interest rate environment.In most financial institutions, Real Assets are also classified as alternatives (\"Alts\"). REIIF, which invests in residential rental real estate, can form a core part of a portfolio within the allocation to Alts.REIIF differs significantly on the risk spectrum from traditional Alts, such as hedge funds or other esoteric strategies, that are more suited to replacing some of the equity exposure in a client portfolio.Analogous to Canada's largest, most sophisticated pension funds (see figure below), portfolio managers could consider between a 20% - 30% allocation within a client's total portfolio to Alts with a focus on Real Assets - replacing the current allocation to bonds that are earning negative 'real' returns.Pension Investment Association of Canada Annual Asset Mix Report100%10%80%31%14%33%30%60%40%59%20%48%38%38%29%:selected: Alternatives40%Equities30%:selected: Bonds0%1990200220152020Responses to Friday, December 2, 2021 Questions :"}, {"id": "Capstone_Responses_24-02-2022_chunk_21", "client_name": "Capstone", "document_name": "Responses", "date": "2022-02-24 00:00:00", "page_number": 10, "content": "1.

How frequently is the NAV priced? Quarterly?

Can you talk a bit about your waterfall structure and how that works with an evergreen fund? Typically waterfall works well in a scenario where there is a terminal value for distribution, in your case you have interim distributions and so when do you \"catch up of 7%\" and profit split? Every year?The entitlement to REIIF's Performance Fees will be made and approved annually as part of the year-end audit by REIIF's Independent Trustees.
