Why are distributions so high relative to FFO? Where is the differential coming from (aside from operating cash flow, where else is distributable cash coming from)?: Forum's Response: In 2022, the FFO payout ratio was above 100% for REIIF. This was due to the 4.5% distribution yield set in January 2022 for Series F investors, which was based on the entire ~$170 million, five property portfolio known as the \"Seed Assets\". The Seed Assets were assumed to be acquired on January 1, 2022, with stabilized occupancy and financed entirely with CMHC-insured mortgages.

This is expected due to the growth of NOI by over 50% from 2022, driven by a full year of income from several properties, occupancy and rental gains across the portfolio, completion of the asset management strategies for the Seed Assets, and replacement of higher cost bridge financing with CMHC-insured mortgages.ForumForum House at Brookfield Place East Podium, 2nd Floor 181 Bay Street Toronto, ON M5J 2T3The Manager is also underwriting several accretive acquisitions that are expected to close later this year.

In the annual investor report, page 14 has the NOI by asset type and geography. What accounts for the fact that each line item is positive for AMR but the total portfolio AMR is negative?: Forum's Response: Q4/22 AMR is lower than Q3/22 due to the addition of Quad C3 & C4 to the portfolio, classified as \"acquisition properties\" on the investor report. The property was acquired in Q4/22 hence no comparative data and its AMR ($1,239) is lower than the Q3/22 portfolio AMR ($1,282). Furthermore, this property is second largest in the portfolio, thus its lower AMR has a higher weighting on the total portfolio."}, {"id": "forumresponsestoechelon(2023.08.29)_chunk_33", "filename": "forumresponsestoechelon(2023.08.29)", "page_number": 20, "content": "Section 23. In the annual investor report, page 30 has the net returns by series. Assuming units are pari passu, Series I should have the highest returns (which it does), Series F should follow, and Series A should have the lowest given the upfront fees and higher asset management fees. Why are Series A returns higher than Series F for 1 month and 3 month?: Forum's Response: The discrepancy was due to an accounting error specific to Series F that needed correction in December 2022. This correctiondisproportionately impacted shorter-term returns (1 & 3 month).The correction has less impact on longer-term returns and therefore the 6/12/Since Inception returns are in line with expectations (Series I has the highest returns, followed by F then A).

Distribution paid to incorrect party: In this case, the Fund would seek to recover the full distributions paid to the incorrect person. If taxes were paid by the receiving party in error, the party should be able to claim a refund of those taxes, making them whole.2. The Fund was required, but failed to withhold taxes payable to a taxing authority on an amount distributed to an investor - in this circumstance the fund administrator will generally distribute the net, after withholding tax amount to the investor. In the event the fund failed to withhold the required taxes, the Fund would request the amount required to pay the withholding taxes to the appropriate taxing authority."}]
